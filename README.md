# Pomodoro-Timer-Project
The pomodoro timer is a timer designed around the work/break interval system of the pomodoro technique.
The pomodoro technique time management system was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally twenty five minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

Thia application was developed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React. It was tested locally using Node.js.

Installion Instructions:
- fork and clone repository
- npm install
- that's it. You should be good to go!

This application was a great learning experience for me. It was an opportunity to implement the various math methods in JavaScript, as well as developing a comfortable working knowledge of React. It was also my first time implementing a progress bar using Bootstrap.

As for what I think I could have done better, there is a lot of functions grouped in the Pomodoro.js file. Each function seems distinct and well-named, however the code can be a little taxing to read through all at once. I'm also aware that there are more comments than are necessary, however I consider this project a learning experience and will be moving forward onto new projects.

I actually use this application quite often myself. I have found the Pomodoro technique to be quite beneficial for me personally.

Thank you for reading to this point, and I hope you find some value in this application! Be well!
