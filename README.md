# Pomodoro-Timer-Project
Timer application based on the Pomodoro work/break technique, used to manage workflow and improve productivity by creating timed work/break sessions.
Developed with an integrated timer progress bar and alarm, and a toggle for the play/pause button.
Application built with VS Code using JavaScript, React.js, React Router, HTML, and Bootstrap, tested locally using Node.js.
Application seems finsihed as is at this point, possibility of stylizing a bit more and potentially deploying.
