# [Pomodoro-Timer](https://pomodoro-timer-project-three.vercel.app/)

## Overview

The pomodoro timer is a timer designed around the work/break interval system of the pomodoro technique.
The pomodoro technique time management system was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally twenty five minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

## Installation
Fork & clone the repository. |
---------------------------- |
cd Pomodoro-Timer            |
npm install                  |
npm start                    |

## Usage

The 'Focus Duration' and the 'Break Duration' can both be adjusted. The 'Focus Duration' can be set in increments of 5, whereas the 'Break Duration' can be set in increments of 1.

The Start button will begin the timer, and a progress bar, along with the time remaining, will display. When the timer has completed, an audible alert will sound to notify you that it time for break. The timer will automatically restart after the 'Focus Duration' and 'Break Duration' have completed.

The timer can be paused or stopped at any point.
